Powered by an internal bluespace shard core, it's primary function is 'shunting' the user across a localized bluespace pocket to 'teleport' them forward. It has trouble responding to modern cybernetic interfaces, yet the internal signature reveals it has been developed by a certain 'Doctor Keagan Higgs'.

These were historically used to mark those born on NanoTrasen-operated outposts as a digital passport, but that use has been phased out over time with the destruction of the company.
